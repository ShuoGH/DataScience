how to use git to clone:
	`git clone xx`
	`cd xx`

when you check the `git branch`, it just show a master branch.
In this case, some branches are hidden.
To list them all:
	`git branch -a`

If you want to checkout to a branch directly, just use
	`git checkout origin/xxbranch`

To make a local branch,
	`git checkout -b xx origin/xxbranch`
	or use `git checkout -t origin/xxbranch`, it will create a branch with same name.
	or use `fetch`, `git fetch origin xxbranch:xx` (in this way, it won't checkout to the new branch automatically)
